                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The ancient Greeks kick-started an amazing series of events on the European continent. These first city-builders began a system of urbanization that would continue to grow and progress for thousands of years after. The system that makes up European Urbanism has gone through plenty of changes since its beginning.  Huge fluctuations in population, urban densities, urbanizing factors, and many other aspects of changed the way urbanism works and the significance of different urban areas throughout the ages.  We can actually see how this system evolved by observing the characteristics of each age.  Starting in the classical era we will move through the dark ages to the medieval period and on to the Renaissance/Baroque era.  From there we continue on through the Victorian/Industrial period, into the time of urbanization between the world wars, and finally ending in the post-war period to see the progression of this unique urban system. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;The classical era started in 800 BCE with the rise of the Greeks, who quickly started building hundreds of small “polis” settlements all over the Aegean Sea and the Peloponnese peninsula.  Even with extensive colonization around the Mediterranean, most of the population at this time was centered on the Aegean Sea, especially around the Saronic Gulf where some of the bigger cities were.  The biggest of the Greek cities was by far Athens with over two-hundred thousand people.  The rest of the polis city-states were probably around twenty thousand.  These polis settlements were the epicenters of social life.  They were civic centers, places of trade and business, and they provided a market.  These were free cities – they governed their own affairs and were true city-states.  Additionally, they provided defense for the citizens of an area if they were under attack.  This need for protection was one of the reasons why they were so important.  There was a lot of competition among the city-states and invasion from outside was not uncommon.  However, there were other factors which contributed to city growth.  One of the biggest reasons for growth was being able to control and manage surrounding farm land.  The large and fertile Athenian plane for instance greatly helped Athens grow to the size it did.  After the early part of the classical era though, the prosperity of the Greek city states would be dwarfed by a new power. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;Beginning around 300 BCE, Rome took over the role of hegemon in the classical world.  By the 2nd century BCE, even the largest of the Greek city-states, Athens, was already subjugated to the Roman Empire. Colonization like never before occurred as Rome invaded and conquered not only the Mediterranean, but also western and northern Europe. There was massive urbanization at this time, especially in northern Africa (Alexandria being the largest at seven-hundred fifty thousand) and Turkey (Antioch being the largest at around five-hundred thousand).  Other cities in Italy and Greece probably grew to around one-hundred thousand at most, of which there were plenty, northern cities to at most fifty thousand, and everywhere else about twenty-five thousand was the max.  However, with around one million people, the capital city of Rome made sure to center the population of Europe firmly on the Italian peninsula.  Cities were the very centers of Roman power and authority, which was a major political reason they were so important.  The Empire was everything.  As opposed to the free city-states of ancient Greece, Roman cities were meant to be extensions of the capitol's dominion.  As such, they dispensed the Emperor's justice and were bureaucratic centers as well as being places of commerce, defense, and society.  They also took on the role of providing entertainment for the masses, building off of what the Greeks had already started with theaters.  The massive urbanization eventually took its toll on the resource-strapped cities though, and the period ended with what is known as the dark ages. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;The dark ages were basically a dismantling of the urban system as continued up by the Roman Empire between 400 and 800 CE.  After expanding from hill-tribes to an empire for over fourteen hundred years, the Roman Empire had become too large and unstable politically to defend successfully; the Pax Romana finally failed.  Barbarian invasions in the heart of the Empire in the west, Viking invasions in the North, and Islamic Moors in the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa (who were incidentally very good to cities) brought the empire to its knees.  The populations of every city declined dramatically – Rome went from around one million people to just over twenty-five thousand.  Those who fled the cities to the countryside were subjected to an entirely different system than what had been in place before: feudalism.  Those with money and land were lords who were able to control production of food, places to live, and armies for protection when needed.  In return for protection, peasants could live on and work the lord's land around his castle so long as they paid him and agreed to be in the lord's army when needed.  This system of feudalism effectively negated the importance of the urban system and power moved into the countryside until the medieval period. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;Beginning around 800, there was a huge resurgence in the importance of cities and urban areas.  On the Iberian Peninsula, which was less feudal, the Moors were doing quite well with their cities with tolerant policies and progressive politics. However, across the rest of the continent it was a different story.  Merchants and manufacturers who had been invited to live within feudal lord's walls were starting to realize that, with more and more trade, they were becoming more powerful.  After a while, lords became indebted to those living under their walls and, leveeing this advantage, the merchants would often charter their independence from the lord, creating a brand new town.  For the first time since the ancient Greeks, we see a world of predominately “free cities.” In essence then, it was trade that “bought” back the urban system, and it was trade that would keep it alive throughout the rest of the middle ages.  Trade, markets and commerce, and providing a real “freedom” opposed to the feudal countryside were the main functions of these towns. A growing Christian church presence in cities also helped put them on the map with Cathedrals, relics, and pilgrimage sites.  Trading towns started cropping up all across Europe and the extensive trading network became the dominate feature of the urban system.  Even with a few larger towns now along the Baltic, France, Moorish Spain, and farther east, the center of population gravity before the black plague in the 1300s was still located firmly south of the Alps near the Mediterranean.  This was largely due to the relatively massive size of Constantinople – the bridge between the east and the west – at three-hundred thousand people in 800 (the next closest was Cordoba at just over half that size).  Most cities were under thirty thousand people. The most pronounced trading system involved goods from the east being sold in Constantinople where they were then picked up by Italian middle-men and shipped up to the Flemish cloth towns of the North.  The cloth towns would then trade woolen items south to Italy where they would head west again through Constantinople.  There was a lot of activity in this city.  Behind Constantinople were a few Moorish cities and then some prosperous Italian trading cities, as well as Paris due to the French monarchy.  Then the black plague struck.  Constantinople was hit the hardest and fell from first place in the hierarchy to 9th, down to seventy five thousand people.  Few cities were spared, but from this turmoil we see the rise of Paris to the top of the rankings, followed by the Italian trading cities and then Flemish cloth towns.  The Moorish cities in Spain fell down the rankings quite a bit, too as they were slowly re-taken by Christian reconquistadors from the North.  The plague started a clear shift in power and population in Europe which headed of the beginning of the Renaissance. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;Powerful cities in the northwest of Europe shifted the balance of the urban system to place it had never been.  For the first time in history, the geographic center of gravity was north of the Alps and substantially west toward the Atlantic seaboard.  This was also a time of massive urbanization, the rates of which haven't been seen since classical Rome.  There weren't many new cities built, but for existing ones and new towns, which included planned residence-cities for royal courts or military towns, populations grew rapidly.  Throughout the period, population in the top fifty cities nearly doubled, as did what it took to even get into the top fifty.  Spurred on by its powerful monarchy, Paris reigned supreme among European cities until the 1600s, when Constantinople pulled itself out of its ashes to become, once again, the most populous city for the rest of the period at seven-hundred thousand people to Paris' three-hundred thousand.  Over the era, other capital cities throughout Europe and port cities along the Atlantic rose through the ranks of the top fifty cities, of which it took forty to fifty thousand people to be a part of.  The number of cities over one-hundred thousand was up to twenty-one by the start of the Victorian/Industrial era.  One of the fastest growing was London, whose population surpassed even Constantinople by 1800.  A large reason for this is because it was fortunate enough to be both a port city and a capital (Amsterdam was much the same way).   Atlantic port cities were important because of the “discovery” of the New World.  The Atlantic seaboard took over from the Mediterranean as the international trading and shipping focus of the world, and exploration in the Americas was of monumental importance. Capitals also became important due to the growing influence of royalty and the government.  They were draws because they were the seats of power as well as prestige.  The cities at this time also took on new meanings.  Capitals became showcases for the wealth and power of the kingdom, and consequently its rulers.  They were meant to impress, intimidate, and provide a vibrant and luxurious atmosphere for the rich while subjugating the poor and middle classes.  Port cities on the other hand were centers of commerce, business, and trade.  Newly created military cities then of course were meant for defense.  Everywhere else continued its purpose of protection, markets, and social life.  The Renaissance/Baroque era was essentially the beginning of the modern urban system, and it was continued in the Victorian/Industrial period. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;The Victorian/Industrial era lasted from about 1800 to the onset of WWI in 1914.  Throughout the era, there was really no bigger influence than the industrial revolution – it changed everything.  The development of mechanized manufacturing caused a massive migration of people from rural areas into manufacturing cities looking for work and a better life.  The urban population grew by nearly six-fold, an astounding number in only about one hundred years, along with the number of people it even took to get into the top fifty cites (from about fifty-five thousand to three-hundred thousand!)  The total population of Europe also nearly doubled as a whole and by the end of it cities contained nearly two-fifths of the population.  London was easily number one with nearly six and a half million people by 1900, Paris was second with just over three million.  Constantinople declined substantially and fell out of the top ten as it just couldn’t keep up with the rapidly expanding cities in the north like Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Manchester, and Birmingham.  Cities along the Mediterranean declined/didn’t grow as quickly too and this again shifted the center of gravity up and to the West in favor of London and Paris. Cities that did by far the best were capitals and manufacturing centers. The industrial revolution can largely account for the growth of manufacturing cities, which provided jobs and new opportunities. Capitals grew for another reason. Capitals were new viewed as the “command hubs” of empires.  As such, they needed to command respect, show off power, and above all, legitimize the nation.  Capitals were in competition to have the biggest, grandest city to showcase their claim on the globe, and the precedent was undoubtedly set by Paris, which may not have been the largest but was definitely envied as the most magnificent.  Increasingly, cities were also being seen as places of leisure, entertainment, and consumption as shopping centers quickly became a major feature of the urban landscape.  This period was characterized by optimism in urban life as well as society as a whole; people looked to a bright future.  Cities were beginning to showcase modernity, technology, and strength.  However, the clouds of war above Europe in 1914 quickly swept all those bright sentiments away. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;World War I was devastating for Europe and when it ended in 1918, feelings about life in Europe had changed.  However, it did leave cities largely untouched.  One of the major changes brought on by the war was a change in ideas about living in cities.  The optimism of the modern urban landscape was replaced by a growing demand for suburbanization away from the big city center with all its noise, lights, and industry.  Still though, cities were growing quite quickly.  Like in the Victorian/Industrial era, capitals and manufacturing cities were still very important.  Around this time, we begin to see the conurbation of industrial cities into giant urban clumps.  The manufacturing of arms for WWI had helped these centers quite a bit.  The fear that huge areas of landscape would become one big city also drove the movement for suburbanization and green-growth.  We also begin to see four capitals in particular that start to rise above the rest: London (still number one with around eight million), Paris (still number two with around five million), Berlin (third throughout most of the period), and Moscow (quickly making its way up through the ranks to later replace Berlin).  With the rise of Moscow and other Eastern manufacturing cities, the center of gravity in this period was shifted east into Germany, but it still remained firmly above the Alps.  The role of cities in this period increasingly became geared toward pleasure-seeking and leisure, with less emphasis on actually living in them.  This was aided by a growing leisure and pleasure-seeking culture spurred on by the aftermath of WWI.  Bigger cities also took on “personalities” and roles they were supposed to play – each major city had to be the “center” of something as an idea of cosmopolitanism took hold.    Paris was artistic, Berlin was decadent, and London was the center of banking and finance.  Suburbanization also helped this by allowing the city to develop an identity separate from being a place to live. In totalitarian states, cities also played an even bigger role for showcasing the power and legitimization of the government by conjuring up images and feelings of a “common” past looking toward a unified future. Rome, parts of Berlin, and Nuremberg were totally redeveloped by the regimes that controlled them.  Totalitarian or not, cities also continued pursue modernity and attract attention for business and government.  So soon after WWI had come and went, another war was at Europe’s doorstep, and this time it wouldn’t be so nice to cities. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;If the devastation of World War One involved more destruction of hum life than human place, World War Two easily made up for the discrepancy.  Not only did millions of people die, but the places they had built and lived were largely obliterated as well.  The Post-war period of urbanization began in 1945 after the war and continued until 1980.  As a result of the war and its destruction of thousands of both rural and urban areas, there was a major housing crisis.  People rushed into cities looking for a place to live and work, where they then had big families in a baby boom.  The population within the top fifty cites during this period nearly doubled again, as did the requirement for being on the top fifty list.  However, the dominate cities also change after the war.  London begins to stagnate and drop in the ranks, as do many of the former industrial cities in a kind of “rust belt” manner.  Paris then rises up to the top, followed by Moscow and Istanbul.  Other cities to gain in prominence include many Mediterranean cities like Milan and Barcelona.  Athens rejoins the top twenty cities for the first time since the classical era.  Another feature of the urban system at this time is that it is majorly divided with the beginnings of the Cold War.  In the west, massive housing blocks were established right away to try and address the housing crisis created by WWII.  This made them places to live, work, and try to get back into modern life.  Eastern cities on the other hand didn't address the housing crisis until much later.  Instead, they focused on expanding industry and flashy showcases of governmental might.  A good example of this would be Riga, Latvia.  It took about twenty years for the Soviet Union nations to catch up with western cities in this way.  Population was also spread differently between East and West.  In the West, there was a full hierarchy of city populations with Paris at the top followed by medium-large cities like London, Milan, and Frankfurt, which were then followed by medium sized cities and so-forth.  In the east, on the other hand, Moscow was emerging as by far the largest city, with everything else below it being substantially smaller and thus missing the next tier down the hierarchy.  This made Moscow a primate city in the east.  Also in the west, a conurbation of large cities arcing from London down through Germany and into Italy formed what is known as the 'Blue Banana.' It was within the middle of this industrial and highly economically developed area that the geographic center of gravity settled down. <br>
	                &emsp;&emsp;The urbanization of Europe stated with the Greeks in their free city-states.  It moved on to the Roman Empire, declined into feudalism in the dark ages, was brought back by trade in the middle ages, was a showcase for royalty and prospered from trans-Atlantic trade in the Renaissance, was bolstered by the industrial revolution in the Victorian age, suburbanized in the inter-war era and ended in the post-war era with a divide between East and West.  A lot happened over the span of more than twenty-seven hundred years but it's not done yet.  The urban system continues to evolve as new challenges and influences affect Europe.  It's been a long process, but it will go on for as long as people live in Europe.
