                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp; Using historical population data and estimates, this map shows the top 50 cities between 1300 to 2010. 
                    Europe's population has undergone dramatic
                    changes through the past few centruries. After having a complete breakdown 
                    following the sack of the Roman Empire in 410, the entire urban system had to reinvent
                    itself. Growth in the years that followed can be categorized into a few major 
                    eras: pre-industrial, industrial, and modern. <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The pre-industrial era includes the subdivisions of Medieval and Baroque-Renaissance. Medieval towns were
                    centers of commerce and trade whereas Renasissance-Baroque cities were designed as 
                    centers of government, military, or royalty.

                    The Industrial Era saw a massive boom in population as new methods of production
                    and a new standard of living was created. Rates of urbanization exploded as people 
                    went to cities to find jobs and a better life. The modern era then saw the devestation of two world war
                    and massive growth when those were over. <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;As you can see, populations start off modest in 1300 and are centered mainly in Italy and around the Mediterranean.
                    With increased trade in the Medieval period through the Renaissance, we start to see
                    a shift northwards and towrad the Atlantic. Then, the industrial revolution in the 1800s makes sure that
                    the center of population was firmly north of the Alps. As we move through the modern
                    era though, we begin to see that populations start to even out across the continent.
